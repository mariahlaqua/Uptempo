## Stack

The MVP of this project is made with **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and the views are powered by **EJS** ~~(NEEM stack? Is that a thing?)~~.
Future versions will integrate **React** and **TailwindCSS** according to the individual preference of the contributors.

## Timeline

Initial meeting: Saturday, September 10th at 12:30 CET.
Live coding session: Sunday, September 11th at 10:30 CET. 
Ideally, we'd like to have this done by the 24th of September.

## Start this locally!

Create an *.env* file, add a port number as well as a MongoDB connection string.
